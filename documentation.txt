Documentation.

This website requires PHP, and MySQL/MariaDB.

The website uses the CodeIgniter PHP framework for its backend and AngularJS JavaScript framework for its frontend logic.

CodeIgniter is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern wherein the 'model' component is in charge of storing data, the 'view' for user interface, and the 'controller' for acting as a middleware between the two as well as displaying views to the user. The models, views, and controllers of this project are stored within /application/ in their respective folders. Every controller extends MY_Controller and every model extends MY_Model, which are both located in /application/core/.


Config:
- the database credentials must be set at /application/config/database.php
- the url of the site can be changed at /application/config/config.php. Look for the 'base_url' config.
- to change the prefix, go to /application/config/constants.php and change the value of DB_PREFIX (must be done before database initialization).
- If the Employee table is taken from an external source, by default the user can't change Employee information. To enable this, go to /application/config/config.php and change the value of 'employee_editable_if_external'.

Core:
-MY_Controller
    -loads the authentication plugin (IonAuth) of the website.
    -Functions:
        -checkLogin - checks if the user is logged-in and is the admin of the website. (non-admin users are not implemented.)
        -index - displays the header and footer views around the result of the 'body' function.
        -body - meant to be overridden. Child classes should add the body of their respective pages to this.
        -html - used for displaying subpages. (e.g: <base_website_url>/<controller-name>/<sub-page>)
        

Controllers:
A controller is called when a user adds the controller's name to the base URL of the site. (
    e.g. Given a base url of http://www.localhost.com/,
        Employee.php is called when the user accesses http://www.localhost.com/employee.
        The functions of Employee.php are called using http://www.localhost.com/employee/functionName.
). The controller's 'index' function  is called when nothing is supplied. The default controller is Main.php.
-Main.php
    - Controls the default page of the website. Checks first if the user is logged in, if so, it displays the homepage, otherwise it displays the login page.
-Calendar.php
    - Manages the Calendar components of the website.
-DB.php
    - DO NOT ACCESS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. This controller is in charge of initializing the database of the website.
-Employee.php
    - Contains the Employee-related logic of the website. In charge of addition, deletion, and editing of employee information as well as the management of employee leave records.

Models:
*Each table generated by this site is prefixed with the DB_PREFIX constant found in /application/config/constants.php
-Employee_Leaves_Model.php
    - Creates and manages the database tables for the employees and leave records.
    - The 'employee_table_meta' table is for storing the meta values of the employee table.
